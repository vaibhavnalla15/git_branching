In this lesson we are merging branches.
We will merge the changes made in the new-branch into the main branch.
The commands used were:
git switch main # Switch back to the main branch
git merge new-branch # Merge the new-branch into main
After merging, the changes from new-branch will be reflected in main.
You can verify this by checking the contents of demo.txt in the main branch.
git checkout main
cat demo.txt
The output will show the content added in the new-branch.
This demonstrates how to merge branches in Git.
Make sure to resolve any merge conflicts if they arise during the merge process.
Happy merging!
