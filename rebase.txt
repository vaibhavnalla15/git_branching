This file is about rebase operations.

rebase means to move or combine a sequence of commits to a new base commit.
It is commonly used to maintain a linear project history.
For example, if you have a feature branch that diverged from the main branch, you can rebase the feature branch onto the latest commit of the main branch to incorporate the latest changes.

The command for rebasing is:
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main

This will replay the commits of the feature branch on top of the main branch.
Conflicts may arise during a rebase if the same lines of code were modified in both branches.
In such cases, Git will pause the rebase process and allow you to resolve the conflicts manually
before continuing.
To continue the rebase after resolving conflicts, use:
git add <file>
git rebase --continue
If you want to abort the rebase and return to the original branch state, use:
git rebase --abort
After a successful rebase, you may need to force push the changes to the remote repository
if the branch has already been pushed:
git push --force
Always be cautious when using rebase, especially with shared branches,
as it rewrites commit history.
