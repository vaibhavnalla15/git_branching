In this file, we will discuss the concept of remote branching.

In this we fetch the branches from a remote repository and create local branches that track those remote branches.
To create a remote branch, you can use the following command:
git checkout -b <local-branch-name> <remote-name>/<remote-branch-name>
or 
git checkout --track <remote-name>/<remote-branch-name>
e.g.
git checkout -b feature-xyz origin/feature-xyz
or
git checkout --track origin/feature-xyz
